# WxApi

Web API using .Net Core 2.2

Hosted on Azure : https://wxapitest.azurewebsites.net/api/

All exercises have been done. 

Exercise 3 done in 2 versions:
 - one relying on /resource/trolleyCalculator api
 - one relying on my own algorithm
 
On my version, the 2nd test isn't passing and I couldn't figure out why !
To test one or other version, just comment/decomment corresponding code in WxApi/Controllers/TrolleyTotalController.
